# Imagine we run a car dealership. We sell all types of vehicles,
# from motorcycles to trucks.We set ourselves apart from the competition
#  by our prices. Specifically, how we determine the price of a vehicle on
# our lot: $5,000 x number of wheels a vehicle has. We love buying back our vehicles
#  as well. We offer a flat rate - 10% of the miles driven on the vehicle. For trucks,
# that rate is $10,000. For cars, $8,000. For motorcycles, $4,000.

#If we wanted to create a sales system for our dealership using Object-oriented
# techniques, how would we do so? What would the objects be? We might have a Sale class,
#  a Customer class, an Inventory class, and so forth, but we'd almost certainly have
#  a Car, Truck, and Motorcycle class.
